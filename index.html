  <p class="blurb">This dashboard shows the results on ongoing surveillance and enforecment of mask wearing
    by all members of the Danforth Campus with the purpose of stopping the spread of COVID-19.

  <h4>Washington University Mask Rules</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>All WashU personnel and visitors are required to wear a mask while on campus. This includes faculty, staff, students, trainees, contractors, vendors, and other visitors. </li>
    <li>The face covering/mask should fit snugly over the mouth and nose.</li>
    <li>Masks must be worn when inside Washington University buildings and garages.</li>
    <li>Masks must be worn when outside on campus unless you are able to keep at least 6 feet between you and other people you do not live with.  For example, if you are walking on a busy sidewalk where you cannot separate from others by 6 feet, you must wear your mask.</li>
    <li>Faculty and students will be required to wear a mask while teaching or attending in-person classes.  If students appear for class without a mask and do not have an approved accommodation, they will be asked to leave the class and not return until they are wearing a mask.</li>
    <li>Instructors may use an approved alternative mask while teaching, if necessary for instruction of hearing-impaired students. </li>
    <li>You may remove your mask while eating (be careful to keep at least 6 feet between you and others you do not live with).</li>
    <li>If you are alone in a closed, individual office or your residence hall bedroom, you may remove your mask. </li>
    <li>If you have a medical condition that may preclude wearing a mask, please contact Occupational Health if you are an employee or the Habif Health and Wellness Center if you are a student to discuss your condition and potential accommodations. </li>
    <li>Children under the age of 2 do not have to wear a mask; however, in general, children shouldnâ€™t be on campus at this time. </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Taking Care of Your Mask</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Wash cloth masks before first use and after every subsequent use. </li>
    <li>Wash your hands before putting on the mask and after taking it off.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Allowed Mask Types</h4>
  <p class="blurb">Gaiters, bandanas and any masks with valves are not adequate and should not be worn.
  Surgical masks, N95 masks, or cloth masks with at least two layers of fabric are acceptable.</p>
